Hi! My name is Carlos Eduardo, also known by my friends as Duda. I'm a brazilian developer and tech enthusiast living in SÃ£o Paulo. I currently work at a major mobile phone carrier as a project manager but I can not be kept away from coding or delving into bits for too long. I'm also a self-learner.

My great passion is write software, fiddling with new technologies and trying to keep up to the latest gadgets available (although, here in my country the proibitive prices are a problem).

When away from computer, I enjoy playing guitar (although I connect it to to computer for recording from time-to-time) and building some electronics DIY stuff like tube guitar amplifiers and generally audio stuff. I also play tennis in amateur level. 

You can see more about my professional profile on [Linkedin](http://br.linkedin.com/in/carlosedp).

## About this site

This site came from the need to have a single place to keep my projects and writings. It is created with [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/) site engine and based on flat-files only, no DB.

The design was created from scratch based on colour palletes from [ColourLovers](http://www.colourlovers.com/) and the design, inspired by lots of sites I visit everyday. Everything was made on VIM and the CSS compiled with [Compass for SASS](http://compass-style.org).

The source for it can be checked on my [GitHub](https://github.com/carlosedp/shallowthoughts) repository.

## Stuff I use

Inspired by the guys from [The Setup](http://usesthis.com/), I created this section where I list the hardware, applications and gadgets I use frequently. If you have any suggestion or a better option for anything I use, please [email me](mailto:me@carlosedp.com?subject=Stuff I Use Feedback). I will be glad to hear you.
