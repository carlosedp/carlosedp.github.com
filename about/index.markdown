Hi! My name is Carlos Eduardo. I'm a Brazilian developer and tech enthusiast from Brazil working at a major mobile phone carrier.

My great passion is write software, fiddling with new technologies and trying to keep up to the latest gadgets available.

When away from computer, I enjoy playing guitar and building some electronics DIY stuff like tube guitar amplifiers and audio stuff. I also play tennis in amateur level. 

You can see more about my professional profile on [Linkedin](http://br.linkedin.com/in/carlosedp).

## About this site

This site came from the need to have a single place to keep my projects and writings. It is created with [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/) engine.

The design was created from scratch based on colour palettes from [ColourLovers](http://www.colourlovers.com/). Everything was made on VIM and the CSS compiled with [Compass for SASS](http://compass-style.org).

The source for it can be checked on my [GitHub](https://github.com/carlosedp/carlosedp.github.com) repository.

## Stuff I use

Inspired by the guys from [The Setup](http://usesthis.com/), I created this section where I list the hardware, applications and gadgets I use frequently. If you have any suggestion or a better option for anything I use, please [email me](mailto:me@carlosedp.com?subject=Stuff I Use Feedback). I will be glad to hear you.
