Hi! My name is Carlos Eduardo, also known by my friends as Duda. I'm a brazilian developer and tech enthusiast living in SÃ£o Paulo. I currently work at a major mobile phone carrier as a project manager but I can not be kept away from coding or delving into bits for too long. I'm also a self-learner.

My great passion is write software, fiddling with new technologies and trying to keep up to the latest gadgets available (although, here in my country the proibitive prices are a problem).

You can see more about my professional profile on [Linkedin](http://br.linkedin.com/in/carlosedp).

## About this site

This site came form the need to have a single place to keep my projects and writings. It is created with [Jekyll](http://#) site engine and based on flat-files only, no DB.

The design was created from scratch based on colour palletes from [ColourLovers](http://www.colourlovers.com/) and the design, inspired by lots of sites I visit everyday. Everything was made on VIM and the CSS compiled with [Compass for SASS](http://compass-style.org).

The source for it can be checked on my [GitHub](https://github.com/carlosedp/shallowthoughts) repository.

## Stuff I use


Inspired by the guys from [The Setup](http://usesthis.com/), I created this section where I list the hardware, applications and gadgets I use frequently.
