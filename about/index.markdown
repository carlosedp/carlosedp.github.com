My name is Carlos Eduardo. I'm a Brazilian developer and tech enthusiast currently working at a major mobile phone carrier.

My great passion is write software, fiddling with new technologies and trying to keep up to the latest gadgets available.

When away from computer, I enjoy playing guitar and building some electronics DIY stuff like tube guitar amplifiers and audio stuff. I also play tennis in amateur level. 

You can see more about my professional profile on [Linkedin](http://br.linkedin.com/in/carlosedp).

## About this site

This site came from the need to have a single place to keep my projects and writings. It is created with [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/) engine.

The design was created from scratch based on colour palettes from [ColourLovers](http://www.colourlovers.com/). Everything was made on VIM and the CSS compiled from SASS with [Compass for SASS](http://compass-style.org).

The source for it can be checked on my [GitHub](https://github.com/carlosedp/carlosedp.github.com) repository.

## Stuff I use

Inspired by the guys from [The Setup](http://usesthis.com/), I created this section where I list the hardware, applications and gadgets I use frequently. If you have any suggestion or a better option for anything I use, please [email me](mailto:me@carlosedp.com?subject=Stuff I Use Feedback). I will be glad to hear you.

Right now, I manage my email, calendar and contacts on [Gmail](http://gmail.com). All of them are in sync with my iPhone 4 and my 13'' MacBook Pro. In the computer, I use Apple's Mail.app, Address Book and Calendar. All my files are kept in sync with [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com). Backups are made into a Seagate 2TB drive using Time Machine.

I browse the web using [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome) usually with the beta channel. My bookmarks are in sync between my Mac and my work computer(a Lenovo PC) using [Xmarks](http://www.xmarks.com) and passwords using the fantastic and free [Lastpass](http://www.lastpass.com). My daily reading is done in Google Reader while at work and Reeder on Mac.

I use some apps to enhance the experience on Mac. [MenuBarFilter](http://eece.github.com/MenuBarFilter/) to invert the menubar, [iStat Menus](http://http://www.islayer.com/) to have a couple widgets (CPU, memory, network), [F.lux](http://http://stereopsis.com/flux/) to have the colors more confortable at night, [SoundSource](http://www.rogueamoeba.com/freebies/) to replace native volume control, [HyperDock](http://hyperdock.bahoom.de) to have windows snapping and app previewing on the Dock and finally [FunctionFlip](http://kevingessner.com/software/functionflip/) to invert some function keys.

All my notes are in [Simplenote](https://simple-note.appspot.com) and I edit them using [NVAlt](http://brettterpstra.com/project/nvalt/) on Mac and Simplenote app on iPhone. For bigger documents I sometimes use Apple iWork or Microsoft Office 2011. I Tweed using [Tweetbot](http://tapbots.com/tweetbot) on iPhone and Twitter client for Mac. I usually IM with [Skype](http://www.skype.com) and Apple's Messages app with [Cocoon](http://cocoon.drinkbrainjuice.com/) for MSN.

I code in a multitude of languages, so my computer generally have Erlang, Python, Ruby, Node.js, all installed with [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew). My favorite editor for everything is Vim ([MacVim](http://code.google.com/p/macvim/) on Mac and gVIM on Windows) with the [vimfiles](https://github.com/carlosedp/vimfiles) configuration from my Github repository.

I'm a music lover and I manage my 106GB library of music with iTunes. All my music is correctly tagged and only enters the library after tagging with [Musicbrainz Picard](http://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Picard). I listen to music using a pair of Grados SR-60i or Klipsch Custom-3 IEM and a DIY [hybrid-tube](http://diyaudioprojects.com/Solid/12AU7-IRF510-LM317-Headamp/) headphone amplifier.
