title: Blackberry has it's niche, like the boring Nokias

I think RIM will have it's own market for a long time and will never be a mainstream phone like the iPhone or Android. It lacks appeal for those that want more than a 'work' phone.

Talking to some executives at the company I work, they feel that Blackberry is the best tool for what it's made for. Reading and writing fast emails anywhere you go.

Sometimes, they don't want fancy apps or a nice UI. They want agility and that's what Blackberry offers. It's like that simple and boring phone you would give to your grandma. Just with the numbers, a green and a red button.
