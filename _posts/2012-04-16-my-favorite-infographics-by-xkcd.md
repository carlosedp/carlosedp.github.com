All these years reading [XKCD](http://xkcd.com) comics, I think the infographics are best ones.

Randall puts so many details and the right dose of comic style that they are kept as a reference.

Here are my favorites:

# Distance and units

* [Distance and units](http://xkcd.com/681/). Gravity Wells, an illustration of the force of gravity in * the Solar System
