A funny take by [Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/01/11/stock-android) on how the manufacturers negotiates their phones to the carriers:

>Android handset makers: _Here are our phones. How would you like us to change them so that you will sell them?_

>Microsoft: _Hereâ€™s [$200 million](http://www.winsupersite.com/article/paul-thurrotts-wininfo/exclusive-microsoft-nokias-plans-marketing-windows-phone-2012-141784). Please sell our phones._

>Apple: _Here is our new phone. It comes in black or white. We will let you sell it._
