Today some of my friends were happy posting on Facebook that Motorola just released Android 2.3 Gingerbread for their Atrix phones here in Brazil. The same update was out on July/2011 in USA.

We are talking about a phone that has been released on April/2011 and just received an update to a version of it's operating system that was released on December/2010, a full year ago. They already  have a new version announced on October/2011 and no one even knows which existing phones will be compatible with Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich.

Compare this to the iPhone lifecycle. The most recent version of it's iOS is 5.0.1, but lets talk about the major versions. 5.0 was released on October/2011 and became available for all iPhones after 3GS, a phone released on June/2009.

Even the iPhone 3G, released on July/2008 received up to iOS 4.2 which was out November/2010.

In my opinion, the big companies like Samsung, Motorola, HTC lack commitment to it's customers satisfaction. Receiving a new OS version with new features motivates customer loyalty. The customers deserve respect and should not keep waiting for months hoping that their top of line phones will not be abandoned in the original OS version.
