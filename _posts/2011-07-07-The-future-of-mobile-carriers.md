title: The Future of Mobile Carriers
---

Another day I was using iMessage (on iOS 5 beta) with a friend and the idea that SMS might be dead sometime with these options like iMessage, BBM, WhatsApp came to my mind. 

The same happened while my wife was travelling and we Skype'd each other on daily basis, it made voice calls useless.

This led me to think about the role of mobile operators in the near future. They will be commodities like water and electricity, just used to carry our data. 

I wonder if they are aware of that. Looks like the carriers think like the recording companies. A whole ecosystem is eating them and they don't seem to perceive that.

What do you think?
