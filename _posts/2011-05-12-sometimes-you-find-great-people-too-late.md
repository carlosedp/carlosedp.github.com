title: Sometimes you find great people too late.

Last week, while going thru my daily reading, a [post](http://http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/05/04/derek-miller) by John Gruber caught my attention.

The post is about the last written piece by Derek K. Miller, who passed away earlier this month after a battle against cancer.

What is enlightening to me is that Derek writes in such a fascinating way that after I read the mentioned post, I could nor stop looking for more of his writing and lead me to return writing.

I really wished I had found his blog earlier to make it part of my reading routine since we shared interest photography, music and tech. Now, what is left is a series of posts as an archive of Derek memories.
