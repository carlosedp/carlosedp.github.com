Today marks the launch of my site. Now it's hosted in my own domain, to keep an identity online. Also, I will begin to transition from my Gmail address to my own domain email (using Google Apps for my domain).

In this site, I built everything from scratch. The structure, layout, design, also I changed the blogging platform, migrating from the Tumblr to Jekyll, a static blog engine that allows me much bigger flexibility (with some drawbacks).

All in all, I'm very happy and plan to post more frequently and bring more content to readers.

Thanks for reading and leave your feedback on [twitter](http://twitter.com/carlosedp) or check the footer for the other networks I'm in.
