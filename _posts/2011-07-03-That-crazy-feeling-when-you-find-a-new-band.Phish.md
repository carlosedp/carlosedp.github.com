title: That crazy feeling when you find a new band. Phish.
---

About a month ago, while reading some posts on [Marco Arment](http://marco.org) blog, one got my attention, the [one about Phish](http://www.marco.org/2011/05/26/geek-intro-to-phish), a rock band that shines on live performances with long jams and heavy improvisation with jazz and fusion elements.

Since that day, Ive been listening to a some of their albums and a bunch of their live performances, which I found amazing.

Like Marco stated, the band strengths is on stage, the guitar tones are great, and the whole band amazes me every new tune I listen.

For the lovers of great music, there's nothing better than finding a previously unknown band and start exploring their tunes discovering new stuff.

For a more detailed explanation about them, check Marco's post but I totally encourage you to check them out. There is a live performance on Columbia,MD that can be listened for free on [Archive.org](http://www.archive.org/details/PhishMerriweather6112011).

Also, don't miss they performing 2001 on [Hampton,VA in 2009](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtzwYn8EIxI) on Youtube. The lights alone
are a show. Don't forget to kick at least 720p.

Later, leave me a feedback if you liked or not.
