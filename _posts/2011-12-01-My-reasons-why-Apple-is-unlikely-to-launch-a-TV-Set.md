title: My reasons why it's unlikely that Apple will launch a TV Set.
---

Everyone is talking about Apple launching a TV set. I think it's highly unlikely and here are my reasons:

1. Apple already have a product for the living room. It's the current AppleTV.
2. An Apple TV set could be just the current AppleTV paired with a screen. If so, what's the difference to your current screen + the current AppleTV?
3. Screens are dumb. The only features they have is resolution, contrast and refresh rate. Today you have great screens with great specs.
4. Why would Apple launch a TV set and hope everyone replaces their own TV's with the new one? Isn't it easier to update the AppleTV box adding new features.

What do you think?
