Charlie points out many factors on Amazon eBook monopoly in [his article](http://bit.ly/IJLVii).

In my opinion, Amazon would win removing DRM from it's ebooks(as long as the publishers accept this) and adding epub support to the Kindle. 

Since the Kindle is the cheapest ebook reader available and Amazon has the biggest inventory available, they won't loose money either in hardware sales (because people would still buy it's readers) and neither ebooks since they have a competitive price and would be available for reading on every device.

It's tipically a win-win situation for everyone except for the pre-historic publishers still with their minds in the 50's.
