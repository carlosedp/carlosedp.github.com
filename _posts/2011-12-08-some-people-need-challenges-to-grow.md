Flaviu nailed the exact same feeling I have about lack of new challenges. I quote a paragraph of [his post](http://blog.eval.me/why-i-quit-my-job-to-build-eval-me) below:


>I feel most alive when learning something new. In any field.

>Most jobs hire you for being relatively good at something. They want you to keep doing that one thing to increase their efficiency.

>While this increases their efficiency in the short run, it hurts them in the long term as you start viewing your job as ‘soul-sucking’.

>The lack of a challenge kills one’s potential. On the other hand, having a startup will always be a challenge.

Recently I'm feeling exactly like this. Being in the same company for 6 years brought a lack of motivation to create new solutions and everything seems automatic.

That's why I try to always keep some side-projects. They could be learning a new language, creating Web app like the ones on my [projects page](http://carlosedp.com/projects) or something related to music. This way I keep my brain from rusting until something great shows up.

Maybe I will try to turn things around soon.

What about you? What keeps you motivated?
