title: The +1 button
---

Reading a Tim Bray [post](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2011/06/02/Plus-one), I figured out that the +1 button is not that useless as I thought previously. It could help improving search optimization for my blog and as everything that improves search, improves the web.

So there it is, the +1 button. I promise I will not add a lot of clutter to the blog with the "follow", "like" and all those social stuff.  My personal networks are in the footer or the [about](/about) page so you know where to find it. I also plan on replacing the Facebook comments with Disqus as soon as I figure out how to make it work.
