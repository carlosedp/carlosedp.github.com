Today marks the launch of my site. Now it's hosted in my own domain, to keep an identity online. Also, I will begin to transition from my Gmail address to my own domain email (using Google Apps for my domain).

Building this site was a huge step for me since I've never made everything from scratch, from structure to the design, CSS, etc.

I also changed the platform for blogging, migrating from the Tumblr one to Jekyll, a static blog engine that allows me much bigger control (with some drawbacks).

All in all, I'm very happy and plan to post more frequently and keep in touch with audience.

Thanks for reading and leave your feedback on [twitter](http://twitter.com/carlosedp) or check the footer for the other networks I'm in.
