title: What would you buy first
---

Another day, [Ben Brooks](http://brooksreview.net/2011/05/buy-first/) posted on his site the software he would buy first if he had to start over. Also, he asked his followers to do the same. I like this kind of posts because it leads to great and otherwise unknown apps. 

Well, here is my list:

* [iStat Menus](http://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/)
* [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com)
* [Lastpass](http://www.lastpass.com). Actually free but well worth getting the premium version
* [Xmarks](http://www.xmarks.com). Free as well but worth getting the premium
* [Microsoft Office 2011](http://www.microsoft.com/mac). I can get it for $15 from a partnership with the company I work for
* [Adobe Photoshop](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html)
* [Reeder](http://madeatgloria.com/brewery/silvio/reeder)
* [Carbon Copy Cloner](http://www.bombich.com/software/ccc.html) free, but worth donation

Also, check other apps I use on [about](http://carlosedp.com/about) page.

What's your list?
